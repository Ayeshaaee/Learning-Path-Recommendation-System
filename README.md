# Learning-Path-Recommendation-System

This repository contains an implementation of a Recommendation System using Matrix Factorization on intern learning data.

Project Overview
Dataset: Internâ€“Course interactions with ratings.
Preprocessing: Created a user-item matrix mapping interns to course ratings.
Algorithm: Implemented a Matrix Factorization model with user and item biases, trained with stochastic gradient descent.
Objective: Predict missing ratings and recommend personalized courses to interns.

Features
Pure NumPy implementation (no external recommender libraries).
Regularization to prevent overfitting.
Configurable hyperparameters: latent factors (K), learning rate (alpha), regularization (beta), and iterations.
Evaluation using training error.

Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates practical knowledge of collaborative filtering, gradient descent optimization, and recommender systems applied in a real-world learning context.
